# Early-Stage GitHub Signals Â· Development Roadmap

## Prompts for External LLMs

These prompt seeds can be used consistently across different LLM interfaces to help develop and enhance the platform:

```
Suggest alternative momentum signals for GitHub repositories that would indicate early-stage potential before mainstream recognition.
```

```
Analyze this JSON sample from our API and identify any additional metrics we should include to improve investor decision-making:
{
  "name": "example-dev/tool-x",
  "score": 8.5,
  "signals": {
    "commit_surge": 3,
    "star_velocity": 2.5,
    "team_traction": 2,
    "ecosystem_fit": 1
  }
}
```

```
Design a scoring algorithm that would better identify high-potential OSS projects with only 2-3 contributors but exceptional quality.
```

```
Suggest improvements to our metrics display in the dashboard to make it more compelling for venture capital investors.

## Tactical Improvements [Q3 2025]

### Sprint 15 (July 1-15, 2025)
1. **Tune scoring weight vs. pass-rate**
   - Calibrate thresholds to avoid prolonged zero-pick weeks
   - Investigate adaptive scoring based on market momentum cycles

### Sprint 16 (July 16-31, 2025)
2. **Add JSON schema documentation**
   - Create formal schema specification for API endpoints
   - Add example queries and response documentation in docs/api/
   - Implement schema validation on output generation

### Sprint 17 (August 1-15, 2025)
3. **Implement first-time-contributor spike detection**
   - Add optional sub-signal for rapid onboarding of new contributors
   - Weight first-time PRs that are non-trivial (>100 LOC)
   - Correlate with subsequent community growth

## Strategic Initiatives [Q3-Q4 2025]

### Q3 2025
1. **Integrate Reddit / X chatter as secondary signal layer**
   - Build connectors for r/programming, r/opensource, and tech Twitter
   - Create sentiment analysis pipeline for mentions
   - Develop correlation scoring between social signals and repo momentum

### Q4 2025
2. **Back-test on historical OSS unicorns**
   - Create dataset of known successful OSS projects (n > 50)
   - Run historical analysis with time-shifted data
   - Publish precision-recall metrics and detection lead time

### Q4 2025 - Q1 2026
3. **Embed shareable "momentum card" images**
   - Design visual template for repository momentum metrics
   - Implement automatic image generation for top-scoring repos
   - Add social sharing integration for founder outreach
   - Create embed code for blogs and partner sites

## Future Explorations [2026+]

- ML-based signal aggregation across heterogeneous data sources
- Private repository analysis for enterprise customers
- Commercial license tracking and dependency network analysis
- Funding event prediction based on momentum trajectory
