## Dashboard Screenshot

To add a dashboard screenshot:

1. Visit the live dashboard: https://cdolik.github.io/early-stage-github-signals/
2. Take a full-width screenshot showing:
   - Header with logo and navigation
   - Several repository cards with scores
   - Filter/sort controls
   - Clean, modern design
3. Save as `dashboard-preview.png` in this directory
4. Optimize for web (compress while maintaining quality)
5. Update the README.md if needed

Recommended dimensions: 1200x800px or similar 3:2 aspect ratio for good GitHub preview.
