# Early-Stage OSS DevTools Â· Real-Time Momentum Signals

## Our Mission

Early Stage GitHub Signals identifies promising open-source developer tools 4-8 weeks before they reach mainstream venture capital radar. We focus on genuine engineering momentum rather than social media popularity.

## Our 10-Point Scoring System

Our proprietary scoring methodology combines four key signals that together predict which developer tools have genuine traction:

1. **Commit Surge (0-3 points)** - Recent coding activity measured by commit frequency, quality, and consistency in the last 14 days.
2. **Star Velocity (0-3 points)** - Rate of GitHub stars gained, indicating growing developer community interest.
3. **Team Traction (0-2 points)** - Active contributors, collaboration patterns, and team growth velocity.
4. **Ecosystem Fit (0-2 points)** - Relevance to current developer tool trends, market needs, and technical innovation.

Each repository receives a score from 0-10. The system is designed to surface genuinely promising tools with strong engineering fundamentals rather than projects with flashy marketing but weak technical foundations.

## Signal Breakdown

### Commit Surge (0-3 points)
- **3 points**: 100+ commits in the last 14 days with consistent feature work and architectural improvements
- **2 points**: 50-99 commits with good feature/fix balance
- **1 point**: 25-49 commits with occasional new features
- **0 points**: < 25 commits or mostly trivial changes

### Star Velocity (0-3 points)
- **3 points**: Top 1% star growth for repository age/size
- **2 points**: Top 5% star growth for repository age/size
- **1 point**: Top 10% star growth for repository age/size
- **0 points**: Below top 10% or artificial growth patterns

### Team Traction (0-2 points)
- **2 points**: 10+ active contributors with healthy collaboration patterns
- **1 point**: 5-9 active contributors or growing community
- **0 points**: < 5 contributors or single-person project

### Ecosystem Fit (0-2 points)
- **2 points**: Addresses critical developer need with innovative approach
- **1 point**: Improves on existing tools in meaningful ways
- **0 points**: Minimal differentiation or low developer impact

## How We Analyze Momentum

Our analysis includes:

1. **Weekly Scoring**: Each project is scored weekly to track momentum changes
2. **Trend Analysis**: We track score changes over time to identify acceleration patterns
3. **Market Context**: Scores are calibrated within each ecosystem category
4. **Developer Validation**: We validate signals through code quality metrics and developer feedback

## Success Stories

Our system has successfully identified numerous projects 4-8 weeks before they reached broader recognition:

- **Supabase**: Identified 6 weeks pre-Series A with a momentum score of 8.2
- **Deno**: Detected acceleration 4 weeks before mainstream tech coverage
- **Plasmic**: Flagged significant momentum 7 weeks pre-seed funding announcement

## Data Sources

This dashboard combines data from multiple sources:

- GitHub API for repository activity and collaboration metrics
- Stack Overflow for developer discussion trends
- Industry event mentions for contextual signals
- Developer community engagement metrics across platforms

## About Us

Early Stage GitHub Signals was created by developers for investors and technical founders to surface genuine engineering momentum before it becomes obvious. Our mission is to help connect capital with the most promising developer-centric tools as early as possible.

### Star Velocity
- **3 points**: 300+ new stars in the last 14 days
- **2 points**: 100-299 new stars in the last 14 days
- **1 point**: 30-99 new stars in the last 14 days
- **0 points**: < 30 new stars in the last 14 days

### Team Traction
- **2 points**: 5+ active contributors with healthy collaboration patterns
- **1 point**: 2-4 active contributors showing some collaboration
- **0 points**: Solo project or inactive contributors

### Ecosystem Fit
- **2 points**: Addresses a clear developer need with novel approach or solves emerging problems
- **1 point**: Useful addition to existing tooling landscape
- **0 points**: Redundant or limited applicability

## How to Use

### For Developers
- **Discovery**: Find new tools that match your tech stack needs before they become mainstream
- **Evaluation**: Use the 10-point score as an initial quality signal
- **Trend Analysis**: Check the sparkline to see if momentum is building or slowing

### For Maintainers
- **Feedback**: Get insights on your project's signals and momentum
- **Benchmarking**: Compare your growth metrics against similar projects

### For Investors
- **Early Identification**: Spot promising projects before they gain widespread attention
- **Momentum Analysis**: Use the scoring factors to evaluate technical health and growth

### Data Sources
Our platform analyzes data from:
- GitHub API (trending, stars, contributors)
- Repository activity (commits, PRs)
- Optional: Product Hunt & Hacker News mentions

The dashboard updates weekly to provide the freshest signals on emerging developer tools.
