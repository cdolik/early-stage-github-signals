# About Early Stage GitHub Signals

## Methodology

Early Stage GitHub Signals uses a 10-point scoring system to identify promising developer tools in their early stages. The scoring methodology considers four primary factors:

1. **Commit Surge (0-3 points)** - Recent coding activity measured by commit frequency and quality in the last 14 days.
2. **Star Velocity (0-3 points)** - Rate of GitHub stars gained, indicating growing community interest.
3. **Team Traction (0-2 points)** - Active contributors and collaboration patterns.
4. **Ecosystem Fit (0-2 points)** - Relevance to current developer tool trends and market needs.

Each repository receives a score from 0-10. This system favors projects showing genuine developer momentum rather than just marketing or social media popularity.

## Signals

### Commit Surge
- **3 points**: 100+ commits in the last 14 days with consistent feature work
- **2 points**: 50-99 commits with good feature/fix balance
- **1 point**: 25-49 commits with occasional new features
- **0 points**: < 25 commits or mostly trivial changes

### Star Velocity
- **3 points**: 300+ new stars in the last 14 days
- **2 points**: 100-299 new stars in the last 14 days
- **1 point**: 30-99 new stars in the last 14 days
- **0 points**: < 30 new stars in the last 14 days

### Team Traction
- **2 points**: 5+ active contributors with healthy collaboration patterns
- **1 point**: 2-4 active contributors showing some collaboration
- **0 points**: Solo project or inactive contributors

### Ecosystem Fit
- **2 points**: Addresses a clear developer need with novel approach or solves emerging problems
- **1 point**: Useful addition to existing tooling landscape
- **0 points**: Redundant or limited applicability

## How to Use

### For Developers

- **Trend Analysis**: Check the sparkline to see if momentum is building or slowing

### For Maintainers
- **Feedback**: Get insights on your project's signals and momentum
- **Benchmarking**: Compare your growth metrics against similar projects

### For Investors
- **Early Identification**: Spot promising projects before they gain widespread attention
- **Momentum Analysis**: Use the scoring factors to evaluate technical health and growth

### Data Sources
Our platform analyzes data from:
